	             <p class="top-side">
	  	             Rama considered an incarnation of god <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu">Vishnu </a> , is a widely worshiped 
				<a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indian_castes">Hindu</a>
 						 deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya. In the 16th century, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid which is believed to be the site of the <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Janmabhoomi"> Ram Janmabhoomi</a> , the birthplace of Rama. A violent dispute arose in the 1850s.

                        In the 1980s, the <a style="color: red" href="https://vhp.org/"> Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP),</a>  belonging to the Hindu nationalist family Sangh Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. In November 1989, the VHP laid the foundations of a temple on land adjacent to the disputed mosque. On 6 December 1992, the VHP and <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party"> the Bharatiya Janata Party</a> organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as kar sevaks. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque. The demolition resulted in several months of intercommunal rioting between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent.</p>

	         A 2003 archaeological excavation by the <a style="color: red" href="http://asiegov.gov.in/">Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) </a> found evidence indicating that a Hindu temple had existed on the site. Over the years, various title and legal disputes also took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Area at <a style="color: red" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/when-congress-brought-ordinance-for-ram-mandir-at-ayodhya-and-bjp-opposed-it-1378516-2018-10-30"> Ayodhya Ordinance</a> , 1993. It was only after the 2019 <a style="color: red" href="https://main.sci.gov.in/"> Supreme Court</a>  verdict on Ayodhya dispute that it was decided the disputed land be handed over to a trust formed by the Indian government for the construction of a Ram temple. The trust was eventually formed under the name Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. Five acres of land was allocated for the mosque elsewhere in the city. On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the Parliament that the <a style="color: red" href="https://www.narendramodi.in/"> Narendra Modi </a>  government had accepted a scheme to construct the temple.

	         <p class="top-side">
	         	
	         	The original design for the Ram temple was prepared in 1988 by the <a style="color: red" href="https://www.oneindia.com/india/ayodhya-ram-mandir-meet-sompura-ahmedabad-based-architects-who-has-been-designing-temple-3129171.html"> Sompura family of Ahmedabad </a> . The Sompuras have been part of the temple design of over 100 temples all over the world for at least 15 generations.The chief architect of the temple is <a style="color: red" href=""></a>Chandrakant Sompura. He was assisted by his two sons Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects.

                    A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the <a style="color: red" href="http://sompuracb.com/"> Sompuras</a>  in 2020, in accordance with Vastu shastra and the Shilpa Shastras. The temple will be 235 feet wide, 360 feet long and 161 feet high. Once complete, the temple complex will be the world's third largest Hindu shrine.[11] It is designed in the Nagara style of Indian temple architecture.[12] A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayag_Kumbh_Mela">Prayag Kumbh Mela</a>  in 2019.[14]

                    				The temple will be built in 10 acres and the 57 acres land will be developed as beautiful complex.[15] The temple complex will have a prayer hall, "a Ramkatha Kunj (lecture hall), a Vaidik Pathshala (educational facility), a Sant Niwas (saints' residence) and a Yatri Niwas (hostel for visitors)" and other facilities like a museum and a cafeteria.[10]

    	<p class="top-side">
    	The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Temple in March 2020.[16][17] However, the <a style="color: red" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19 </a> pandemic lockdown in India followed by the 2020  <a style="color: red" href="https://eurasiantimes.com/just-like-1962-war-china-wants-to-seize-strategic-heights-near-indian-airforce-base/"> China–India  </a>skirmishes caused a temporary suspension of the construction. During ground-leveling and excavation of the construction site a  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam "> Shivaling </a> , pillars and broken idols were found. On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanathingam"> Yogi Adityanath </a> .

		In preparation for its construction, the   <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YoVishwa_Hindu_Parishadi_Adityanathingam">Vishwa Hindu Parishad </a>  organised a   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva "> Vijay Mahamantra </a>  Jaap Anushthan, in which individuals would gather at different places to chant the Vijay Mahamantra, Shri Ram, Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram, on 6 April 2020. This was said to ensure "victory over hurdles" in the construction of the temple.[23]

		Larsen & Toubro, which reportedly offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost, is the contractor of the project.[24][25]

		The construction work will be accomplished with 600 thousand cubic feet of sandstone   <a style="color: red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baansi">  Bansi mountain </a> stones from Rajasthan. Thirty years ago, more than two hundred thousand bricks etched with the   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama "> 'Sri Rama' </a>  in several languages had arrived from various parts of the country will be utilized in the foundation.[15] The temple development is expected to be finished in the subsequent three years from the date of commencement of work after laying the foundation stone.[26]

		The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir construction has begun, and the engineers have collected the soil samples for testing at the site. Primeval and customary techniques will create the shrine. The shrine will be strong enough to sustain earthquakes, storms, and other natural calamities. There will be no use of iron in the construction of the temple. The fusing of the stone blocks will require the Ten thousand copper plates. The size of each dish shall be 18 inches long, 30 mm breadth, and 3 mm depth.[27]

    	<h2 class="headingfont" >Ground-breaking ceremony </h2>
    	<p class="bottom-side">
    		
    		The temple construction officially started again after a ground-breaking ceremony on 5 August 2020. Three-day long Vedic rituals were held ahead of the ground-breaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg silver brick as the foundation stone by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.[2] On 4 August, the   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama "> Ramarchan Puja </a>  was performed, an invitation to all the major gods and goddesses.

			On the occasion of the   <a style="color: red" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/celebrations-mark-bhoomi-puja-at-ayodhya/article32280088.ece"> Bhoomi-Pooja </a> , soil and holy-water from several religious places across India, Triveni Sangam of rivers   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges "> Ganga </a> ,  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna "> Yamuna </a> ,  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati "> Saraswati </a>  at  <a style="color: red" href="https://prayagraj.nic.in/"> Prayagraj </a> ,  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talakaveri "> Kaveri river at Talakaveri </a> ,   <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakhya_Temple"> Kamakhya Temple </a> in Assam and many others, were collected.[29][30][31] Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, Gurudwaras and Jain Temples across the nation to bless the upcoming temple. Among the many was Sharada Peeth located in Pakistan.[32][33][34] Soil was also sent form the four pilgrimage locations of Char Dham.[35] Temples in United States,  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "> Canada </a>  and  <a style="color: red" href=" https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-islands-visit-caribbean/ "> Caribbean Islands </a>  held a virtual service to celebrate the occasion.[36] Rama's image were shown at Times Square.[37][38] All 7,000 temples in a 7 km radius of  <a style="color: red" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman_Garhi_Temple "> Hanumangarhi </a>  were also been asked to join in the celebrations by lighting diyas.[39] Muslims devotees in Ayodhya who consider Rama as their ancestor also looked forward to the bhoomi-puja. Spiritual leaders from all faiths were invited on the occasion.[40]

			On 5 August, Prime Minister Modi first offered prayers at Hanumangarhi temple to seek blessings of Hanuman for the day's events.[41][42] Following this the ground breaking and foundation stone laying ceremony of Ram Mandir took place.[41] Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Bhagwat, Nritya Gopal Das and Narendra Modi gave speeches.[41] Modi started his speech with Jai Siya Ram and he went on to urge those in attendance to chant Jai Siya Ram.[43][44][45] He stated, "the call of Jai Siya Ram is resonating not only in the city of Lord Ram but throughout the world today" and that "Ram Mandir will become the modern symbol of our traditions".[46][47] Narendra Modi also paid his respects to the many who had made sacrifices for the Ram temple.[48] Mohan Bhagwat also thanked L. K. Advani for his contributions to the movement to get the temple built.[48] Modi also planted a sapling of the Parijat.[49] In front of the deity, Modi performed a dandvat pranam/ sashtang pranam, lying completely prone on the ground with hands outstretched in prayer.[50]

			Orthodox priests and religious leaders complained that the ceremony did not follow proper ritual procedures, pointing out, among others, that 5 August was not a ritually auspicious date and that the function did not include a havan.[51] In this respect, writer Arundhati Roy pointed out that the chosen date marked one year since the revocation of the special status of  <a style="color: red" href=""></a> Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that the decision to schedule the ceremony for 5 August, an inauspicious date with no significance in the Hindu calendar, symbolized the conclusion of a period "in which India under Modi has formally declared itself a Hindu Nation, the dawning of a new era."[52] [53]

			Various political leaders hailed the ground-breaking ceremony. While some openly celebrated it, others worded their statements carefully.[54] Many expressed hope in furthering the country's progress by following the ideals of Ram.[55]

			Soon after the ground-breaking ceremony, residents of Ayodhya expressed hope in improvements of job opportunities and development of the city, through tourism generated by the temple.[56]

			Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendees at the temple were limited to 175.
